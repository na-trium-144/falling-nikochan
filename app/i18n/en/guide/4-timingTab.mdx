- In the Timing tab, you can set timing-related settings such as offset, BPM, and time signature.
- Offset specifies the timing at which the score starts in the video (the start of the first beat of the first measure).
  - The offset is a common setting for all levels.
- The default BPM and speed are 120, and the default time signature is 4/4.
  - It is also possible to change these midway through the score.
  - You can also set different BPM, speed, and time signature values for each level.
