  (or the [What is Falling Nikochan?](/main/about/1) overview page).
  - On iOS, you can install it by selecting "Add to Home Screen" from the share button in Safari.
  - When launched as an app from the home screen, the browser toolbar will be hidden, allowing you to play comfortably in full screen.
  - (Also, when launched as an app, the entire app is downloaded before launching, so the page loads faster in slow internet environments.)

  - On Windows, Linux, MacOS (except Safari) and Android, the judgement timing is automatically adjusted by the delay in audio output.

- Added a stop button at the top of the screen during play.
