- You can add a note at the current cursor position and change the note's position, angle, and speed.
- Instead of specifying the note's position and speed numerically,
you can change them with the mouse from the note preview displayed on the left.
  - When there is a note at the current cursor position, dragging in the preview screen will move the note's position, and dragging while holding down <Key className="text-sm p-0.5 mx-0.5">Shift</Key> will change the note's speed.
  - For touch operation, press the <span className="inline-block w-5 translate-y-0.5 "><Move /></span>Touch mode
  button to switch to a mode in which you can move the note's position/speed by touch operation.
- The copy, paste, and 1 to 9 buttons below allow you to copy and paste notes.
  - The buttons in the lower row copy the settings of the note at the current cursor position.
  - Pressing the corresponding buttons in the upper row will overwrite and paste the note at the current cursor position.
  - Or if there are no notes present when you paste, notes will be added.
