- You can create multiple chart data (levels) for one song.
- You can give a name to the level. It is not necessary to give a name.
- You can choose the level type from
"<span className={levelColors[0]}>{levelTypes[0]}</span>"
"<span className={levelColors[1]}>{levelTypes[1]}</span>"
"<span className={levelColors[2]}>{levelTypes[2]}</span>".
  - <span className={levelColors[0]}>{levelTypes[0]}</span> limits the number of notes that can be placed at the same time to one.
  - Similarly, <span className={levelColors[1]}>{levelTypes[1]}</span> limits the number of notes that can be placed at the same time to two.
  - There are no restrictions on <span className={levelColors[2]}>{levelTypes[2]}</span>.
- The level is automatically assigned a number (1 to 20) that indicates the difficulty of the chart.
  - This is automatically calculated based on the amount (density) of notes in the chart.
