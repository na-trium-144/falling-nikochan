- In the Meta Information tab,
  - Specify the video ID
  - Enter information such as the song title, composer, and chart creator
  - Save the chart
- By saving the chart on the server, a chart ID and sharing link will be generated, allowing other people to play the chart.
  - Furthermore, by checking "Publish this chart",
  it can be added to the chart list on the "Play" page of the Falling Nikochan homepage.
- If you change the chart data (notes, speed, time signature, etc.) and save it, the date and time display will be updated.
The date and time will not be updated if you only change information such as the title or composer.
- You can also download and save the chart to your own PC (or tablet, smartphone, etc.).
  - Falling Nikochan's server is not very trustworthy,
  so we recommend that you not only save it on the server but also keep a copy for yourself.
  - It can also be used to temporarily save charts that you are in the process of creating without sending them to the server.
