- In the Meta Information tab,
  - Specify the video ID
  - Enter information such as the song title, composer, and chart creator
  - Save the chart
- By saving the chart on the server, a chart ID and sharing link will be generated, allowing other people to play the chart.
  - Furthermore, by checking "Publish this chart",
  it can be added to the chart list on the "Play" page of the Falling Nikochan homepage.
- You can also download and save the chart to your own PC (or tablet, smartphone, etc.).
  - Falling Nikochan's server is not very trustworthy,
  so we recommend that you not only save it on the server but also keep a copy for yourself.
  - It can also be used to temporarily save charts that you are in the process of creating without sending them to the server.
